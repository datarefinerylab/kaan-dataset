# KAAN Dataset: Building Projects Across the Netherlands

## Overview

The KAAN dataset includes architectural data corresponding to more than 800 apartment units related to four building projects across the climatic context of the Netherlands. The projects spread over the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Eindhoven over three different provinces of North Holland, South Holland, demonstrating variety in development and city context. The data is sourced from commercial clients of KAAN Architecten, a Rotterdam-based architectural firm that combines academic knowledge with practical application in architecture, urbanism, and the built environment.

## Data Format

The project's data is converted to two CSV (comma-separated value) files mainly containing geometry, IFC classes, and material properties of the projects' architectural elements. The geometrical data of the elements is provided in WKT (well-known text) format, representing each element by a multipolygon which is both machine-readable and human-interpretable. Alongside the name and IFC type of each element, geometry is presented in a CSV file per floor for each project.
