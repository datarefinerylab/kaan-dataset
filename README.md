# KAAN Dataset: Building Projects Across the Netherlands

## Overview

The KAAN dataset includes architectural data corresponding to more than 800 apartment units related to four building projects across the climatic context of the Netherlands. The projects spread over the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Eindhoven over three different provinces of North Holland, South Holland, demonstrating variety in development and city context. The data is sourced from commercial clients of KAAN Architecten, a Rotterdam-based architectural firm that combines academic knowledge with practical application in architecture, urbanism, and the built environment.

## Data Format

The project's data is converted to two CSV (comma-separated value) files mainly containing geometry, IFC classes, and material properties of the projects' architectural elements. The geometrical data of the elements is provided in WKT (well-known text) format, representing each element by a multipolygon which is both machine-readable and human-interpretable. Alongside the name and IFC type of each element, geometry is presented in a CSV file per floor for each project.

## Projects

| Project Name | Location | Status | Use Configuration | Design Duration | Gross Floor Area (m2) | Number of Storeys | Project Description |

| **The Stack** | North Amsterdam | Built | 120 apartments with a communal garden in between | 2017 - 2019 | 11,400 | 9 | It consists of two separate buildings and Apartment units are positioned such a way that they are oriented towards the sun as much as possible. |
| **Matchbox** | Strijp-S area of Eindhoven | Construction | offices on the ground floor and apartment units on upper levels surrounding an inner courtyard | 2018 - 2023 | 4,800 | 7 | wooden construction, usage of bio-based materials, integrated solar panels, rain water collection system, and natural cross ventilation contribute to the sustainable design aspect of the project. |
